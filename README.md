# scratch_network
My attempt to create a basic neural network from scratch in Python

TODOS:
- Backpropagation method for each layer and activations
  - Find the necessary calculus to determine correct derivatives, as well as a choice to select the type of backpropagation
- Forward propagation for each layer and activations
  - Relatively straightforward, this will be the perceptron algorithm
- Implementation of activation functions
  - Giving an option to decide activation functions
- Implementation of the network class
  - Listing layers and activations
